# DevOps Intro
## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a continuous process.
Start with planning the application before developing the code.
The code is stored in a repository where it is updated regularly
This is known as version control
Once the code is completed it is then executable
The code is tested for bugs and errors before being handed to the operations team
The operations deploy the code to a working environment
Continuously monitored and sent back the planning phase to then work on ways
to upgrade and update the software

## Development Env

- Install Vagrant
- install nginx
- added a Vagrant file with commands to initialise a VM
- Provided a IP address to the VM to be able to access VM through a web browser
