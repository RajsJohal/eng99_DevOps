# DevOps Intro
## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a continuous process.
Start with planning the application before developing the code.
The code is stored in a repository where it is updated regularly
This is known as version control
Once the code is completed it is then executable
The code is tested for bugs and errors before being handed to the operations team
The operations deploy the code to a working environment
